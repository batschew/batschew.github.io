		<h1>Project: Installing Linux to hardware</h1>
		<div class="box">
			<h2>Outline</h2>
			<div class="textbox">
			<p>For this project, I decided to install a Linux operating system distribution to a physical computer. I have set up Linux virtual machines in the past, but prior to this project, I had not installed it to hardware.</p>
			<p>The distribution that I chose, <b>Pop!_OS</b>, is derived from the popular <b>Ubuntu</b> distribution. It is maintained by a US-based hardware company called <b>System76</b>.</p>
			<p>Installing Linux to hardware is simple if you plan to overwrite the contents of the disk, but I wanted to preserve Windows 10 on a separate partition so I could boot into either system at my choosing. This setup, termed <b>dual-booting</b>, is significantly more complex.
			</div>
			<br />
			<h2>Process</h2>
			<div class="textbox">
			<p>After burning an ISO of Pop!_OS to a flash drive and booting into the installer, I encountered errors with the graphical display. I inferred that these were due to the fact that the hardware I was installing Pop!_OS to was using an NVIDIA graphics card with proprietary drivers. As Linux is a free and open source operating system, it usually does not provide these drivers out of the box.</p>
			<p>I was able to resolve this problem by entering a text-only command line, from which I was able to download the drivers from the distribution's repositories. After this was completed, the graphical errors were resolved and I was able to resume the installation process.</p>
			<p>I manually partitioned the disks (an SSD and an HDD) to provide space for the distribution, while preserving the data on the Windows partitions.</p>
			<p>The image below shows the computer's <b>UEFI boot menu</b>, which is maintained in the device's <b>BIOS</b>. Both Pop!_OS and Windows are available. Selecting either option will cause the system to boot into the chosen OS.</p>

			<h2>Results</h3>
			<div class="textbox">
			<p>With the disks partitioned and the drivers successfully installed, I was able to complete the system's installation.</p>
